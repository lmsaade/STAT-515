**Introduction**

My name is Lina Saade, I'm in STAT 515 for Fall 2025. I am working towards completing my Masters in data analytics engineering. I graduated from GMU with my bachelors in information systems and operations management back in 2020 and actually had a virtual graduation due to COVID.

I currently work at Booz Allen as a data engineer, so my day-to-day isn’t as focused on analytics, but that’s how I originally got into this field. I’m hoping to get more familiar with R; I mainly use Python for work, but I enjoy R’s layering approach to data visualization.

Outside of school and work, I like to game, cook, and do nails. Some of my favorite games I’ve played this year are Expedition 33 and Warhammer 40K: Space Marines II.
